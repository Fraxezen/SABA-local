Place Holder = 
    Inserts a placeholder for a tensor that will be always fed.
    A placeholder is simply a variable that we will assign data to 
    at a later date. It allows us to create our operations and build 
    our computation graph, without needing the data. In TensorFlow
    terminology, we then feed data into the graph through these 
    placeholders.
